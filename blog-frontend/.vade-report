Vercel Web Analytics Installation and Configuration
===================================================

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/analytics` version ^1.6.1 to dependencies
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json accordingly

### 2. Modified Files
- **app/layout.tsx**: 
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<SessionWrapper>` closing tag
  - Placement ensures analytics are tracked across all pages while maintaining the existing component structure

### 3. Implementation Details
- This is an App Router project (uses app directory structure)
- The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx)
- Placed after {children} to ensure it loads after the main content
- All existing code structure, imports, and functionality were preserved
- The component is positioned correctly within the body tag alongside existing SessionWrapper and Navbar components

### 4. Verification
- ✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✓ Linter ran successfully (pre-existing issues in other files were not introduced by these changes)
- ✓ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✓ All 7 pages generated successfully in production build

## Files Modified:
1. `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
2. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
3. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package dependency tree

## Notes:
The Analytics component will automatically start tracking page views and web vitals once the application is deployed to Vercel. No additional configuration is required for basic analytics tracking.
